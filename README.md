# Central
This repository will serve as a central source of information for everyone and potentially be used later for full integration.

## Problem Statement
Supply Chain Management Software

## Basic Info
- Everyone uses MVC patterns for all subsystems
- Everyone has to integrate with the error handling subsystems
- Your subsystem is considered complete when:
	- It is fully functional
	- It integrates successfully with at least two other subsystems
- Subsystems assigned at random
